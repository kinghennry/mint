            It's early in the morning the forest was echoed by the chatter
            sound. All the apes were extremely busy with their work. All the
            apes were experts in their field Vianney was engaged in operating
            the aircraft. Samey, an incredible astronaut was working on his
            mission and was verifying tools and procedures to connect the real
            world with the virtual world while doing different experiments Ali
            the most genius ape was attempting to invent something. The rest of
            the apes perform environmental protection through planting trees,
            conserving water, and educating everyone about the importance of the
            environment. When every ape was busy doing productive work. One of
            the apes named zozo was known for his witty personality and had
            goofy behavior that made everybody laugh. He stole human clothes
            wore them and started dancing on the streets.

            Being the leader of the apes' Mike always supervises his community
            and had a very friendly personality and never did any brutality
            toward the apes and was a sociable person. He loved celebrations and
            use to celebrate every moment with great zeal and zest. One day Mike
            the leader organized a splendid party for the ape community. Every
            ape was so eager about the party because they knew that Mike's party
            would be ideal. The moment arrived for which every ape was
            desperately waiting. The apes wore their elegant Khakis shirts with
            ties. There was loud music the apes twisted tightly together and
            jumped on the base of the music. There was a collection of wines in
            the bar for apes who were lost in the music and were unaware of the
            outside world.

            Suddenly there was a bombastic voice and there was a deep silence in
            the club. Ape became terrified and when they went out of the club
            they saw that heavy machinery was cutting down the trees and all
            their happiness turned into sorrow. The next day they found that
            everything was destroyed by the cruel humans. It was a very
            heartbreaking moment for all the apes to see the destruction and
            environmental damage. It was hard for Mike to see his motherland in
            such a worst condition as the life of 10k apes was in trouble all he
            wanted was to protect his realm. Food and water were deficient. The
            air was completely polluted which made their survival difficult. The
            apes never expected such reckless behavior from humans.

                To us, the community comes first. The goal is to make our drop
                as successful as possible, to have the freedom to develop
                Climate Ape. We will announce our drop release date once we are
                satisfied with the projectâ€™s quality and technical parts. We
                will also be working tirelessly with our community to guarantee
                our social media platforms are at a high aesthetic standard and
                create new concepts over time.

                At the same time, we love the NFT space and It has allowed us to

                of the space going, we are going to introduce a list of projects
                that we aim to assist funding. As a member of the Climate Ape,

                we want to connect with our community, so, we will be hosting a
                pilot IRL event for our holders. The first event will take place
                within 6-months after the drop, and the community will vote to
                choose the location between different cities in the world. After
                discussion with some of the most influential people in the NFT
                and Crypto industry, we are currently working to bring them to
                the event. The event will be private and only for our holders.
                Food and drinks will be provided for all holders. Legendary
                holders will be invited to the event with an all inclusive
                package (flight, hotel, food, drinks and special activities).
                Imagine yourself with all Climate Ape members, holding a glass
                of champagne and hanging out discussing new ways to grow Climate
                Ape. Since we know that some of our Members will not be able to
                attend, we will broadcast the event LIVE, and soon in the
                metaverse...
